> A demo blogging platform to learn [React Query](https://reactquery.com/).

## Notes

- The login screen is made just to make it look fancy, type anything and press enter.
- I've used [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/), minimal CSS framework for semantic HTML, for quick setup. I didn't want to spend too much time worrying about the UI. I like it minimal and ugly.
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is used for all the API endpoints.

## Setup

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/AbhayVAshokan/blogger.git
cd blogger
yarn install
```

- Start the development server using `yarn start`. The application will be running on port `3000`.

> Nothing fancy, just another project to learn something new!
